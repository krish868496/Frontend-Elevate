# 🧠 JavaScript Scope and Scope Chaining: Beginner to Advanced

## ✅ What is Scope in JavaScript?
**Scope** determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. In JavaScript, scope defines where variables, functions, and objects are accessible in your code.

### 📦 Types of Scope:
1. **Global Scope** – Accessible everywhere.
2. **Local/Function Scope** – Available only inside a function.
3. **Block Scope** – Introduced in ES6 with `let` and `const`, available inside `{}`.

## 🔍 1. Global Scope Example
```javascript
let globalVar = 'I am global';

function showGlobal() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
}

showGlobal();
console.log(globalVar); // Also accessible here
```

---

## 🔍 2. Function Scope Example
```javascript
function localScope() {
  let localVar = 'I am local';
  console.log(localVar); // Works fine
}

localScope();
console.log(localVar); // ❌ ReferenceError
```

---

## 🔍 3. Block Scope Example
```javascript
if (true) {
  let blockScoped = 'Only in this block';
  console.log(blockScoped); // ✅
}

console.log(blockScoped); // ❌ ReferenceError
```

## 🔁 What is Scope Chaining?
Scope chaining refers to the process of looking for a variable from the innermost scope outward (lexical environment).

If a variable isn’t found in the current scope, JS looks to its parent scope, continuing up to the global scope.

### 🔗 Scope Chaining Example
```javascript
let name = 'Global';

function outer() {
  let name = 'Outer';
  
  function inner() {
    console.log(name); // Looks up and finds 'Outer'
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

## 🚧 Common Mistakes
- Using `var` which is function-scoped, not block-scoped.
- Not understanding hoisting can affect variable accessibility.
- Assuming inner scope can't access outer variables (they can).

---

## 🤖 Real-Life Analogy
Think of scopes like Russian nesting dolls:
- Inner doll can see outer dolls (scope chaining).
- Outer dolls cannot see inside inner dolls.

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1. What is the difference between block, function, and global scope?
**A:**
- Block: Exists in `{}` with `let`/`const`
- Function: Declared inside a function
- Global: Declared outside any block or function

### Q2. What is scope chaining in JS?
**A:** When a variable is not found in the current scope, JS searches in outer scopes in the lexical chain.

### Q3. Can inner functions access outer variables?
**A:** Yes, due to scope chaining.

### Q4. What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` regarding scope?
**A:**
- `let` & `const`: block-scoped
- `var`: function-scoped, can lead to bugs

### Q5. Is scope related to closures?
**A:** Yes. Closures retain access to outer scopes even after the outer function has executed.

## 📘 Final Tips
- Always prefer `let` and `const` over `var`
- Understand the scope chain to avoid bugs and unexpected outputs
- Practice writing nested functions to reinforce these concepts
