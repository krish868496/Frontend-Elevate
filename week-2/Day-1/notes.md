## üîÅ 1. What is Copying in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, objects and arrays are **reference types**, which means:

```js
const a = { name: "John" };
const b = a;

b.name = "Doe";

console.log(a.name); // "Doe"
```

To **prevent this mutation**, we use copying.

## üßä 2. Shallow Copy

A **shallow copy** creates a new object or array, but only **copies the first level** of properties. Nested references are not cloned.

### ‚úÖ Common Methods:

```js
const shallow = { ...original };
const copy = Object.assign({}, original);
```

### üß™ Example: Shallow Copy Pitfall

```js
const original = {
  name: "Alex",
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    zip: 12345,
  },
};

const shallow = { ...original };
shallow.address.city = "Los Angeles";

console.log(original.address.city); // "Los Angeles"
```

---

## üß¨ 3. Deep Copy

A **deep copy** means cloning *everything*, even nested objects and arrays ‚Äî completely independent from the original.

### ‚úÖ Deep Copy Using `structuredClone()`:

```js
const deep = structuredClone(original);
```

### ‚úÖ Deep Copy Using `lodash.cloneDeep()`:

```js
import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';

const deep = cloneDeep(original);
```

### üß™ Advanced Example: Deep Copy with Nested Arrays

```js
const original = {
  user: {
    name: "John",
    roles: ["admin", "editor"],
  },
};

const deep = structuredClone(original);
deep.user.roles.push("manager");

console.log(original.user.roles); // ["admin", "editor"]
```

## ‚öõÔ∏è 4. Real-World Scenarios in React/Redux

### üß® Shallow Copy Mistake in React State

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({
  name: "John",
  address: { city: "NY" },
});

const updateCity = () => {
  const updated = { ...user };
  updated.address.city = "LA";
  setUser(updated);
};
```

‚úÖ **Solution:**

```jsx
const updateCity = () => {
  const updated = {
    ...user,
    address: { ...user.address, city: "LA" },
  };
  setUser(updated);
};
```

## üß† 5. Advanced Copying Techniques

### ‚úÖ Deep Copy with JSON (‚ö†Ô∏è Caution!)

```js
const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
```

üî¥ Not suitable for:
- `undefined`
- `functions`
- `symbols`
- circular references
- Dates

### ‚úÖ Custom Recursive Deep Copy

```js
function deepClone(obj) {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== "object") return obj;

  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    return obj.map(deepClone);
  }

  const result = {};
  for (const key in obj) {
    result[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
  }
  return result;
}
```

## ‚ùó 6. Gotchas You Must Know

| Method                        | Limitations                         |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `{ ...obj }`                 | Only 1-level shallow copy            |
| `Object.assign()`            | Shallow copy + source mutation risk  |
| `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` | Loses non-serializable values     |
| `structuredClone()`          | Fast, safe, but not in older browsers |
| `lodash.cloneDeep()`         | Reliable, but increases bundle size  |

## ‚úçÔ∏è Final Thoughts

Understanding how data is copied is crucial in JavaScript, especially when building UIs where immutability matters. Whether you're debugging a React component or optimizing performance in Redux ‚Äî knowing when and how to use shallow or deep copy is a skill that separates junior and mid-level developers.
